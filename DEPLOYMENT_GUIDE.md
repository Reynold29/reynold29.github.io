# Deployment Guide: Frontend (Netlify) + Backend (Railway)

This guide will help you deploy your hymns management system with the frontend on Netlify and backend on Railway.

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub repository with your code
2. Netlify account
3. Railway account
4. GitHub Personal Access Token

## Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

### 1.1 Prepare Your Backend

1. Make sure your backend code is in the `dashboard/backend/` directory
2. Ensure `package.json` has the correct dependencies and scripts
3. Verify your `server.js` has proper CORS configuration for Netlify

### 1.2 Deploy to Railway

1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/)
2. Click "New Project" and select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - **Root Directory**: `dashboard/backend`
   - **Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js app**
   - **Build Command**: `npm install` (automatic)
   - **Start Command**: `npm start` (automatic)

### 1.3 Set Environment Variables

In your Railway project settings, add these environment variables:

```
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-personal-access-token
GITHUB_OWNER=Reynold29
GITHUB_REPO=csi-hymns-vault
USERS_JSON=[{"username":"admin","password":"your-password","role":"admin"}]
```

**Important Notes:**
- Generate a strong JWT_SECRET (you can use a password generator)
- Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with repo permissions
- Update the USERS_JSON with your actual admin credentials
- The PORT will be automatically set by Railway

### 1.4 Get Your Railway URL

After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
`https://your-app-name-production.up.railway.app`

## Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Netlify

### 2.1 Update Frontend Configuration

1. Update `dashboard/frontend/src/config.js`:
   ```javascript
   production: {
     apiUrl: 'https://your-app-name-production.up.railway.app' // Your actual Railway URL
   }
   ```

2. The backend CORS is already configured to accept requests from Netlify domains.

### 2.2 Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the build settings:
   - **Base directory**: `dashboard/frontend`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Node version**: `18`

### 2.3 Set Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to use environment variables for the API URL:

1. In Netlify site settings, go to "Environment variables"
2. Add: `REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-app-name-production.up.railway.app`

## Step 3: Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your Netlify URL
2. Try logging in with your admin credentials
3. Test the hymns and keerthane functionality
4. Verify that edits are being saved to GitHub

## Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)

### For Netlify:
1. Go to your site settings in Netlify
2. Navigate to "Domain management"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update CORS origins in your backend

### For Railway:
1. Go to your project settings in Railway
2. Navigate to "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update frontend config with your custom domain

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Make sure your backend CORS configuration includes your Netlify URL
2. **404 Errors**: Ensure your Netlify redirects are configured correctly
3. **Authentication Issues**: Verify your JWT_SECRET and user credentials
4. **GitHub Sync Issues**: Check your GitHub token permissions

### Debug Steps:

1. Check browser console for frontend errors
2. Check Railway logs for backend errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Test API endpoints directly using tools like Postman

## Security Considerations

1. Use strong, unique passwords
2. Generate a secure JWT_SECRET
3. Limit GitHub token permissions to only what's needed
4. Consider using HTTPS for all communications
5. Regularly update dependencies

## Monitoring

1. Set up logging in your backend
2. Monitor Railway service health
3. Set up Netlify form notifications if needed
4. Consider setting up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

## Updates and Maintenance

1. Push changes to GitHub to trigger automatic deployments
2. Monitor your services for any issues
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Regularly backup your data

## Why Railway + Netlify?

âœ… **No spin-down** - Railway keeps your backend running  
âœ… **Fast cold starts** - No 30-60 second delays  
âœ… **Generous free tier** - $5/month usage on Railway  
âœ… **Easy deployment** - Both platforms have simple GitHub integration  
âœ… **Custom domains** - Available on both platforms

**Your deployment is now complete!** ðŸŽ‰

Your frontend will be accessible at your Netlify URL, and it will communicate with your backend on Railway without any spin-down delays!
